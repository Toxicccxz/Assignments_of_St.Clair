    <p>Write a css stylesheet called assignment1.css that uses text-shadow and
    box-shadow to make the following four paragraphs look as they do in the two
    reference images. section A has 2 shadows, section B has 2 shadows, section
    C has 3 shadows, section D has 4 shadows. Colours used are red, green and
    blue. You are not expected to recreate the reference exactly: you should
    look out for which direction the shadows faces and how sharp the shadow is
    compared to other shadows. submit only the file assignment1.css</p>
