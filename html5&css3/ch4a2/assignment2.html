    <p>Write a css stylesheet called assignment2.css that uses linear-gradient
    and repeating-linear-gradient to make the following four paragraphs look as
    they do in the two reference images. Each section has one gradient, three
    are linear-gradient and one is repeating-linear-gradient. Colours used are
    red, blue, black, white. You are not expected to recreate the reference
    exactly: you should look out for which direction the gradient progresses and
    where the colours are placed.</p>
