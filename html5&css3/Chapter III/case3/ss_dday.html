      <h1>The Normandy Invasion</h1>
      <p>The invasion on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, was the largest air, land, and sea operation 
         undertaken before or since June 6, 1944. <em>Operation Overlord</em> involved over 150,000 service
         men stationed on over 5,000 ships and 11,000 airplanes. The initial wave of soldiers on the beaches
         had to cover over 200 yards of small-arms fire and artillery before reaching any protection.
         Casualties were immense: 4000 men died on the beaches, 6000 were wounded.</p>
      <p>The landing beaches were intended to provide footholds that would allow rapid reinforcement and expansion 
         inland by joining the beach flanks to create a continuous perimeter before the enemy could mount a 
         major counter-attack. Each beach would be assaulted by approximately one army division, with 
         initial landings made from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. Their beach landings followed bombardment by 
         ships' guns and aircraft ordnance, kept brief to maintain as much as possible of the element of 
         surprise. As a result, German shore defenses remained intact and a threat to the landing forces.</p>
      <p>Supporting the beach landings, especially at Omaha Beach, the U.S. 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions 
         descended behind enemy lines in the early hours of D-Day. Though badly scattered and lacking much of 
         their equipment, the paratroopers kept the Germans occupied and helped ensure that the beach assaults 
         were successful. By nightfall on the sixth of June, the beaches were secured and the liberation of 
         the European continent had begun.</p>

            <h2>Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise</h2>
            <p>The 82nd Infantry Division mistakenly landed directly in the town of Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise 
               at 1:40 a.m., resulting in heavy casualties. Burning buildings illuminated the night sky, making
               the defenseless paratroopers easy targets and the down-draft from the flames sucked several men
               into the fires. Other troopers were caught hanging from trees and utility poles and shot before 
               they could cut themselves loose.</p>
            <p>However, the Germans were confused by conflicting reports of allied landings and attacks and
               retired in the middle of the night. This contributed to the ease by which the 505th PIR took
               the town by 5:00 a.m. The lightly armed troops held the town against heavy German 
               counter-attacks, finally securing it on June 7th with help from tanks sent from nearby
               Utah Beach.</p>

            <h2>Utah Beach</h2>
            <p>Utah Beach was a staging area to secure the important port facilities at Cherbourg. It was added
               later in the D-Day planning and necessitated a month-long delay for the assembly of additional l
               landing crafts. Troops landed in four waves beginning at 6:30 a.m. and were met with minimal
               resistance. The 4th Infantry Division landed 21,000 troops on Utah suffering only 197 casualties.
               By the end of June 6th, Allied forces had captured only about half of their objectives,
               but the beachhead was secure and could be used as an important staging area in subsequent days.</p>
            <p>Cherbourg was captured on June 26, but only after the Germans had destroyed the port facilities.
               The port was not fully operational until September.</p>

            <h2>Omaha Beach</h2>
            <p>Very little went according to plan at Omaha Beach. Most of the landing craft missed
               their targets and came up against unexpectedly-strong opposition. Under heavy fire,
               army engineers worked to clear beach obstacles but the time required to clear the
               beach caused subsequent landing crafts to bunch up and obstruct the clear landing
               channels.</p>
            <p>Eventually small groups of survivors were able to improvise an assault on the
               entrenched German troops. By the end of June 6, two isolated footholds on the beach
               were achieved and were exploited over the next several days as the invasion forces
               moved inland.</p>

            <h2>Gold Beach</h2>
            <p>The British landing at Gold Beach was designed to link up with forces at Omaha Beach and 
               move inland to Bayeux. High winds made it difficult to establish a beachhead and the
               amphibious assault did not begin until 7:30 a.m. However heavy bombardment disabled
               three of the four large German guns covering the beach.</p>
            <p>Due to stiff German resistance, Bayeux was not captured until June 7. British casualties 
               at Gold are estimated at 1,000–1,100. German casualties are unknown.</p>

         <div class="mapInfo" id="info5">
            <h2>Juno Beach</h2>
            <p>The objective at Juno ws to seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen and link up 
               with the invasion forces at Gold and Sword. The beach was defended by two German 
               battalions and a panzer division, making it the second most heavily defended beaches
               on D-Day.</p>
            <p>The landings encountered heavy early resistance and early ship bombardment was ineffective at 
               breaking up the German forces. The push inland towards Carpiquet achieved mixed results with
               the sheer number of forces on the beach delaying reinforcements. However by 11 p.m., the
               invasion force had reached its objectives and succeeded in pushing farther 
               inland than any other landing force on D-Day.</p>

         <a id="marker6" class="battleMarkers" href="#marker6"><img src="ss_marker.png" alt="" /></a>
         <div class="mapInfo" id="info6">
            <h2>Sword Beach</h2>
            <p>Sword was the easternmost landing site of the Normandy Invasion. Sword was divided into 
               several sectors with each sector divided into beaches. Sword is located about 9 miles
               from Caen, the goal of the 3rd Infantry Division.</p>
            <p>The Sword landing suffered few casualties but it's route inland suffered from traffic
               congestion that limited the invasion's effectiveness. Troops at Sword experienced the
               only armour counter-attack of D-Day, mounted by the 21st Panzer Division.</p>
