    <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
    <img src="ms_euler.png" alt="Math Strings" />

    <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong>
     was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics,
    <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
    and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most 
    prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over <em>800 different books and 
    papers</em>. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

    <p>He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's 
    work, <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, remained a standard textbook
    in the field for well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote 
    <cite>Lettres &agrave une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, giving a clear non-technical
    outline of the main physical theories of the time.</p>

    <p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying Euler. 
    Notations still in use today, such as <var>e</var> and &pi;, were introduced 
    in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind 
    a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals 
    of mathematics.</p>

    <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

    <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:

    <p>cos(<var>x</var>) + <var>i</var>sin(<var>x</var>) = <var>e</var> <sup>(<var>ix</var>)</sup>

    <p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the identity:

    <p><var>e</var><sup>(&pi; <var>i</var>)</sup> + 1 = 0

    <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, &pi;, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in
    a single beautiful and elegant statement. A poll of readers conducted by <cite>The Mathematical
    Intelligencer</cite> magazine named Euler's Identity as the most beautiful
    theorem in the history of mathematics.
